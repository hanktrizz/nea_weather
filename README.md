# AngularJS Singapore Weather App

Using the open weather API data by National Environment Agency (NEA), we have created a Singapore-specific weather app. The app provides all the important details Singaporeans would likely care about in a condensed UI that is both usable and modern. The app is a prototype as part of our foray into AngularJS.

## Getting Started

The project is already structured according to project structure recommendation by AngularJS and can be launched directly through a localhost server. Use localhost to serve 'index.html' page to kick things off.

### Prerequisites

An NEA API key may/may not be required.

### Installing

None required.

## Running the tests

Feel free to deploy your own Jasmine or Protractor test suites to run in Karma test runner.
We did not include these in the project.

### Compatibility

Tested only on Google Chrome and Chrome mobile so far. Internet Explorer (all versions) is not supported.
